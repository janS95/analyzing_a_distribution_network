# Analyzing a distribution network

# Project Overview:
* Read network data from a distribution network in the USA
* Node attributes: Population, Location (Latitude, Longitude)
* Edge weight: Travelling Cost for this connection
* Plot the graph diagram corresponding to location
* Highlight NYC and LA for better orientation
* Use Population (Node Size) and Travelling Cost (Edges width) for styling
* Red Edges: Travelling Cost greater than 770 $
